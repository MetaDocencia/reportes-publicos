<p>This report presents an overview of the participants who attended ALTa Ciencia Abierta, the Latin American contextualization of NASA’s Open Science 101 course, in 2024. It offers a snapshot of their backgrounds, representation, accessibility needs, and prior knowledge and attitudes toward Open Science practices. The findings aim to inform future iterations of the program and contribute to the ongoing development of inclusive, community-driven training in the region.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-remarks">Final remarks</h3>
<p>The data collected from participants of ALTa Ciencia Abierta 2024 offers a valuable snapshot of the current landscape of researchers and technical staff engaging with Open Science in Latin America. With representation from 19 countries, a wide range of academic backgrounds, and diverse levels of experience in research, this community exemplifies both the richness and the heterogeneity of the region’s scientific ecosystem.</p>
<p>Out of all participats conducting research, almost half identify as belonging to one or more underrepresented groups in science. This reinforces the importance of designing inclusive training spaces that recognize and support intersectional identities and trajectories.</p>
<p>The results also show that while there is strong appreciation for Open Science values, especially in regard to publishing research results in open journals and sharing through alternative media, certain practices such as preregistration, data management planning, and code sharing remain less familiar or less commonly adopted. This gap highlights the need for further training, mentoring, and community-building efforts to lower the barriers to implementation and foster a culture of openness that is both robust and context-sensitive.</p>
<p>As we move forward, this baseline information will help guide the adaptation of future training materials and the development of targeted support strategies that align with the realities of Latin American researchers. In this way, ALTa Ciencia Abierta continues to contribute to a more inclusive, equitable, and collaborative scientific future.</p>
